# Euler Vault Kit

The Euler Vault Kit is a system for constructing credit vaults. Credit vaults are ERC-4626 vaults with added borrowing functionality. Unlike typical ERC-4626 vaults which earn yield by actively investing deposited funds, credit vaults are passive lending pools. See the [whitepaper](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-vault-kit-white-paper/) for more details.
